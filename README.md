| **Resume screening & doc review** | "Turn the 50 resumes in this folder into a screening sheet, flag anyone missing the JD's hard requirements, then shortlist the best 10." |
| **Keeps learning** | "From now on, keep every document you write for me clear, logical, and concise." — saved to long-term memory |

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/res/architecture_v2_en.png" alt="Architecture" width="500">
</p>

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24 < 25
- **npm**

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-app
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cowork mode runs on the **OpenClaw** agent engine. The **first launch must build the OpenClaw runtime**, or Cowork sessions won't start. Use the `electron:dev:openclaw` command for the first run.

```bash
# First run: builds the OpenClaw runtime, then starts the app.
# Clones & builds OpenClaw on first run — this can take several minutes.
npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

Once the runtime has been built, day-to-day development can use the faster command —
it reuses the existing runtime and skips the OpenClaw build step:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

The Vite dev server runs at `http://localhost:5175`. By default the app connects to
the configured production services. Login, model, and plan features depend on the current backend configuration.

#### OpenClaw build options

The required OpenClaw version is pinned in `package.json` under `openclaw.version`, and
its source is cloned/managed at `../openclaw` (relative to this repo) by default.

```bash
# Use a custom OpenClaw source path
OPENCLAW_SRC=/path/to/openclaw npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Force a rebuild even when the pinned version hasn't changed
OPENCLAW_FORCE_BUILD=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Skip the automatic version checkout (e.g. when developing OpenClaw locally)
OPENCLAW_SKIP_ENSURE=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

### Production Build

```bash
# TypeScript compilation + Vite bundle
npm run build

# ESLint check
npm run lint
```

## Packaging & Distribution

<details>
<summary>Build commands, channel packages, manual runtime build & Windows Python bundling</summary>

Uses [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to produce platform-specific installers. Output goes to `release/`.

```bash
# macOS (.dmg)
npm run dist:mac

# macOS - Intel only
npm run dist:mac:x64

# macOS - Apple Silicon only
npm run dist:mac:arm64

# macOS - Universal (both architectures)
npm run dist:mac:universal

# Windows (.exe NSIS installer)
npm run dist:win

# Linux (.AppImage & .deb)
npm run dist:linux
```

Build channel-specific packages by setting `KEYFROM`:

```bash
# macOS - Intel only
KEYFROM=xxx npm run dist:mac:x64

# macOS - Apple Silicon only
KEYFROM=xxx npm run dist:mac:arm64

# Windows (.exe NSIS installer)
npx cross-env KEYFROM=xxx npm run dist:win
```

Desktop packaging (macOS / Windows / Linux) bundles a prebuilt runtime under `Resources/yuzhh-runtime`.
The pinned OpenClaw version (`package.json` → `openclaw.version`) is automatically fetched and built during packaging — no manual setup needed.
The build is cached: if the runtime for the pinned version already exists locally, the build step is skipped automatically.

You can also build OpenClaw runtime manually:

```bash
# Build runtime for current host platform (auto-detect mac/win/linux + arch)
npm run openclaw:runtime:host

# Build explicit targets
npm run openclaw:runtime:mac-arm64
npm run openclaw:runtime:mac-x64
npm run openclaw:runtime:win-x64
npm run openclaw:runtime:linux-x64
```

Override OpenClaw source path with an environment variable when needed:

```bash
OPENCLAW_SRC=/path/to/openclaw npm run dist:win
```

Windows builds bundle a portable Python runtime under `resources/python-win` (included as installer resource `python-win`), so end users do not need to install Python manually.
The bundled runtime is interpreter-focused and does not preinstall 宇智汇和 AI 助手 skill Python packages; those can be installed at runtime on demand.
By default, packaging downloads the official Python embeddable runtime from python.org if no prebuilt archive is provided.
For offline/non-network builds, provide a prebuilt runtime archive explicitly.

Offline/runtime source options for packaging:
- `LOBSTERAI_PORTABLE_PYTHON_ARCHIVE`: Local prebuilt runtime archive path (recommended for offline CI/CD)
- `LOBSTERAI_PORTABLE_PYTHON_URL`: Download URL for the prebuilt runtime archive
- `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_EMBED_PYTHON_VERSION` / `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_EMBED_PYTHON_URL` / `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_GET_PIP_URL`: Optional overrides for Windows-host bootstrap sources

</details>

## Architecture

宇智汇和 AI 助手 uses Electron's strict process isolation. All cross-process communication goes through IPC.

### Process Model

**Main Process** (`src/main/main.ts`):
- Window lifecycle management
- SQLite persistence
- OpenClaw agent engine (primary) + CoworkEngineRouter dispatch layer
- IM Gateways — WeChat, WeCom, DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Telegram, Discord, POPO remote access
- 40+ IPC channel handlers
- Security: context isolation enabled, node integration disabled, sandbox enabled

**Preload Script** (`src/main/preload.ts`):
- Exposes `window.electron` API via `contextBridge`
- Includes `cowork` namespace for session management and stream events

**Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/`):
- React 18 + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS
- All UI and business logic
- Communicates with main process exclusively through IPC

## Cowork System

Cowork is the core feature of 宇智汇和 AI 助手 — an AI working session system powered by OpenClaw as the primary agent engine. Designed for productivity scenarios, it can autonomously complete complex tasks like data analysis, document generation, and information retrieval.

<details>
<summary>Execution modes, stream events & permission control</summary>

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` | Automatically selects based on context |
| `local` | Direct local execution, full speed |

### Stream Events

Cowork uses IPC events for real-time bidirectional communication:

- `message` — New message added to the session
- `messageUpdate` — Incremental streaming content update
- `permissionRequest` — Tool execution requires user approval
- `complete` — Session execution finished
- `error` — Execution error occurred

### Permission Control

All tool invocations involving file system access, terminal commands, or network requests require explicit user approval in the `CoworkPermissionModal`. Both single-use and session-level approvals are supported.

</details>

## Skills System

宇智汇和 AI 助手 ships with a rich set of built-in skills covering productivity, creative, investment research, and automation scenarios, configured via `SKILLs/skills.config.json`. Below are some typical examples:

## Scheduled Tasks

宇智汇和 AI 助手 supports scheduled tasks that let the Agent automatically execute recurring work on a set schedule.

### How to Create

- **Conversational** — Tell the Agent in natural language (e.g., "collect tech news for me every morning at 9 AM"), and it will create the scheduled task automatically
- **GUI** — Add tasks manually in the Scheduled Tasks management panel with a visual interface for configuring timing and task content

### Typical Scenarios

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| News Collection | Automatically gather industry news and generate a summary every morning |
| Inbox Cleanup | Periodically check your inbox, categorize emails, and summarize important ones |
| Data Reports | Generate a weekly business data analysis report |
| Content Monitoring | Regularly check specific websites for changes and send notifications |
| Work Reminders | Generate to-do lists or meeting notes on a schedule |

Scheduled tasks are powered by Cron expressions, supporting minute, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly intervals. When a task fires, it automatically starts a Cowork session. Results can be viewed on the desktop or pushed to your phone via IM.

## IM Integration — Mobile Remote Control

宇智汇和 AI 助手 can bridge the Agent to multiple IM platforms. Send a message from your phone via IM to remotely trigger the desktop Agent — command your personal assistant anytime, anywhere.

| Platform | Protocol | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| WeChat | OpenClaw gateway | WeChat account integration, supports DMs and group chats |
| WeCom | OpenClaw gateway | WeCom app bot, supports DMs and group chats |
| DingTalk | OpenClaw gateway | Enterprise bot, supports multiple instances |
| Feishu | OpenClaw gateway | Feishu/Lark app bot, supports multiple instances |
| QQ | OpenClaw gateway | QQ bot (official Bot API), supports multiple instances |
| Telegram | OpenClaw gateway | Bot API, supports webhook and polling |
| Discord | OpenClaw gateway | Discord bot, supports servers and DMs |
| NetEase IM | node-nim V2 SDK | [NetEase IM P2P messaging](https://doc.yunxin.163.com/messaging2/getting-started) |
| NetEase Bee | node-nim V2 SDK | [NetEase Bee personal digital assistant](https://wp.m.163.com/163/html/bee/lobsterai_guide/index.html) |
| NetEase POPO | OpenClaw gateway | NetEase POPO enterprise IM, supports WebSocket and Webhook |

Configure the corresponding platform Token/Secret in the Settings panel to enable. Once set up, you can send instructions directly to the Agent from your phone IM (e.g., "analyze this dataset", "make a weekly summary PPT"), and the Agent will execute on the desktop and return results.

## Persistent Memory

宇智汇和 AI 助手's memory system is built on OpenClaw and persists information as files in the working directory, so the Agent remembers your preferences and context across sessions.

### Memory File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MEMORY.md` | Durable facts, preferences, and decisions — loaded automatically at session start |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily notes — preserves recent context |
| `USER.md` | User profile (name, occupation, habits, long-term info) |
| `SOUL.md` | Agent personality and behavioral principles |

### How Memories Are Written

- **Explicit instructions** — Say "remember that…" or "from now on reply in English," and the Agent calls the `write` tool to save to `MEMORY.md` before acknowledging — no silent "mental notes"
- **Agent-initiated** — The Agent can proactively write important findings, configurations, or environment notes to memory files during task execution, without explicit prompting
- **GUI management** — Add, edit, or delete entries in `MEMORY.md` directly from the Settings panel; keyword search is supported

### How It Works

At the start of every session, OpenClaw reads `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, today's and yesterday's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and `MEMORY.md` in sequence, injecting them as context. This lets the Agent pick up where it left off without you needing to re-explain preferences.

Memory writes go through file tools — there is no background extraction or inference. Content is fully under user or Agent control.

## Data Storage

All data is stored in a local SQLite database (`yuzhh-ai-assistant.sqlite` in the user data directory).

<details>
<summary>Database tables</summary>

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `kv` | App configuration key-value pairs |
| `cowork_config` | Cowork settings (working directory, system prompt, execution mode) |
| `cowork_sessions` | Session metadata |
| `cowork_messages` | Message history |
| `user_memories` | User memory entries |
| `user_memory_sources` | Memory source tracking |
| `agents` | Custom Agent configurations |
| `mcp_servers` | MCP server configurations |
| `im_config` | IM gateway config (tokens/secrets per platform) |
| `im_session_mappings` | Mapping between IM conversations and Cowork sessions |
| `scheduled_task_meta` | Scheduled task metadata (origin and binding info) |

</details>

## Security Model

宇智汇和 AI 助手 enforces security at multiple layers:

- **Process Isolation** — Context isolation enabled, node integration disabled
- **Permission Gating** — Tool invocations require explicit user approval
- **Workspace Boundaries** — File operations restricted to the designated working directory
- **IPC Validation** — All cross-process calls are type-checked

## Tech Stack

<details>
<summary>Full tech stack</summary>

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Electron 40 |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 |
| State | Redux Toolkit |
| AI Engine | OpenClaw (primary) |
| Storage | better-sqlite3 |
| Markdown | react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-katex |
| Diagrams | Mermaid |
| Security | DOMPurify |
| IM | @larksuiteoapi/node-sdk · nim-web-sdk-ng · @wecom/wecom-aibot-sdk · OpenClaw gateway (DingTalk / Telegram / Discord / QQ etc.) |

</details>

## Configuration

### App Configuration

App-level config is stored in the SQLite `kv` table, editable through the Settings panel.

### Cowork Configuration

Cowork session config includes:

- **Working Directory** — Root directory for Agent operations
- **System Prompt** — Customize Agent behavior

### Internationalization

Currently English and Chinese are supported. Switch languages in the Settings panel.

## OpenClaw Version Management

<details>
<summary>Version pinning, how it works, updating & env vars</summary>

宇智汇和 AI 助手 pins its OpenClaw dependency to a specific release version, declared in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "openclaw": {
    "version": "v2026.4.14",
    "repo": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git"
  }
}
```

### How It Works

| Step | What happens | When |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Version ensure** | Clones or checks out the pinned tag in `../openclaw` | Before every runtime build |
| **Build cache check** | Compares pinned version with `runtime-build-info.json` | Before every runtime build |
| **Full build** | `pnpm install` → `build` → `ui:build` → pack to asar | Only when version changed |

### Updating OpenClaw Version

1. Change `openclaw.version` in `package.json` to the desired release tag
2. Run `npm run electron:dev:openclaw` or `npm run dist:win` — the new version is fetched and built automatically
3. Commit the `package.json` change

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENCLAW_SRC` | Path to OpenClaw source directory | `../openclaw` |
| `OPENCLAW_FORCE_BUILD` | Set to `1` to force rebuild even if version matches | — |
| `OPENCLAW_SKIP_ENSURE` | Set to `1` to skip automatic version checkout | — |
| `LOBSTERAI_SQLITE_BACKUP_ALWAYS_ON_STARTUP` | Set to `1` or `true` to force an automatic backup on every app startup for QA/testing | — |

</details>

## Development Guidelines

- TypeScript strict mode, functional components + Hooks
- 2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons
- Components: `PascalCase`; functions/variables: `camelCase`; Redux slices: `*Slice.ts`
- Tailwind CSS preferred; avoid custom CSS
- Commit messages follow `type: short imperative summary` (e.g., `feat: add artifact toolbar`)

## Testing

<details>
<summary>Running tests & writing test files</summary>

Unit tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and are co-located with the source files they cover.

```bash
# run all tests
npm test

# run tests for a specific module (Vitest filename filter)
npm test -- logger
npm test -- cowork
```

New test files go next to the source file they test, using the `.test.ts` extension:

```
src/main/
├── foo.ts
└── foo.test.ts
```

Example (`src/main/logger.test.ts`):

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest';

test('log file pattern matches daily name', () => {
  expect(/^main-\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.log$/.test('main-2026-03-20.log')).toBe(true);
});
```

Avoid importing Electron-only APIs (e.g. `electron-log`) in tests — inline any logic that depends on them instead.
